description: Though his later novels took a turn toward political and romantic matters,
  Robert W. Chambers' early works mined a unique vein of the horror genre that has
  come to be known as ""weird"" fiction. Though he soon abandoned his literary ambitions
  in this direction, his early works gained a large following, including admirers
  such as H.P. Lovecraft, who regarded the horror novel In Search of the Unknown as
  one of the best works in the genre.
